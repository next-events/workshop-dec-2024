content-speak: While LLMsâ€™ reasoning and generalization capabilities can aid higher level user understanding and longer term planning for recommendations, directly applying them to industrial recommendation systems have been shown challenging. The talk will cover our recent proposal on a hybrid approach to combine LLMs and classic recommendation models, and study its effectiveness for a challenging recommendation task on user exploration.
