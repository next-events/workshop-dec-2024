bio: <b>Dr. Julian McAuley</b> has been a professor in University of California San Diego (UCSD) since 2014, where his lab works on problems in the area of Personalized Machine Learning. Broadly speaking, his lab’s research seeks to develop machine learning techniques for settings where differences among individuals explain significant variability in outcomes. A core instance of this problem is that of recommender systems, one of the core areas of his lab’s research, where he develops technologies that underlie algorithms like those used for recommendations on Netflix, Amazon, or Facebook. 
content-title:  Data, methods, and evaluation for knowledge-grounded conversational recommendation systems
content-speak: In this talk we'll explore the current landscape of conversational recommendation in light of new developments on Large Language Models. We'll look at ways that current models can potentially be improved by exploring new datasets, methods, and evaluation protocols for conversational recommendation.
